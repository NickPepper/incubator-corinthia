#              .GITIGNORE FOR KEEPING BUILDS OUT OF THE REPOSITORY
#
#   This .gitignore file is designed to eliminate build setups and their
#   output from being committed to and carried in the repository.  This is
#   part of a structure where anyone can do multiple flavors of builds
#   along-side the source without cluttering the repository iself.

# If all build operations are confined to the build/ folder or are conducted
# outside of the repository folder, they will be automatically excluded from
# the repository.  Nothing produced by editors, IDEs, or build tools should
# be placed anywhere else in the repository but build/.

# 0.06 2015-08-09T10:17 Removed now-obsolete use of external/ as part of
