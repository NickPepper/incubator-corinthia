*** (orcmid).  I did a grep to find all of the places that have an iconv.h
*** dependency.  These are what I found.  Note that inconv.h shows up as an

./DocFormats/platform/3rdparty/w3c-tidy-html5/src/iconvtc.c:#include <iconv.h>

Binary file ./external/download/iconv-1.9.2.win32.zip matches

./external/download/include/iconv.h:/* When installed, this file is called
    "iconv.h". */

./external/download/include/iconv.h:   errors because some other system header
    file includes /usr/include/iconv.h

./external/download/include/iconv.h:   But gcc's #include_next is not
    portable. Thus, once libiconv's iconv.h

./external/download/include/iconv.h:   include the original
    /usr/include/iconv.h. We simply have to get away

./external/download/include/iconv.h:   #include "iconv.h"  or  #include_next
    "iconv.h"

./external/download/include/iconv.h:   is small. They all do #include
    <iconv.h>.

./external/download/include/libxml/encoding.h:#include <iconv.h>

./external/download/include/SDL_stdinc.h:# include <iconv.h>
